# doxbot

Existing on the internet can be treacherous if you get on the wrong side of the wrong person. doxbot attempts to minimize damage in Twitch chat for users who have been doxxed and want to keep their personal information out of chat. While this is a very limited subset of the venues for information distribution, it is a start and may be able to help until you can get an admin to ban the relevant IP/accounts.
